Question
I experienced myself as separate from my changing thoughts and feelings.
I was more concerned with being open to my experiences than controlling or changing them.
I experienced my thoughts more as events in my mind than as a necessarily accurate reflection of the way things ‘really’ are.
I was receptive to observing unpleasant thoughts and feelings without interfering with them.
"I was more invested in just watching my experiences as they arose, than in figuring out what they could mean."
"I approached each experience by trying to accept it, no matter whether it was pleasant or unpleasant."
I was aware of my thoughts and feelings without overidentifying with them.
